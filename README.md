# Mobile flashcards app

This project is part of the
[React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) program by Udacity.
The main goal here is to show how to utilize [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to create mobile apps for
Android and iOS.

The following topics has been covered:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Async storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/)
- [Local notifications](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/)

## Usage
1. `npm install` or `yarn install` to install project dependencies
2. `expo start` to start the development server
3. Scan the QR code to open the app on your mobile device or run it in the emulator.
   - If you want to use emulator, you need to follow the instructions on how to install the environment
     [for Android](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
     or [for iOS](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/) (available on Mac only)
     
Note: 
- This app was tested on Android Studio emulator using Pixel 4 device (Android 10, API v. 29) 
and on physical iOS device (v. 14).
- Notification runs daily at 18:00. You can set it to `null` to show it immediately in Android emulator.
